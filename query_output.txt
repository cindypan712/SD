                  "description": "My career in agriculture has been gradually building over the past decade. I initially came to farming because I wanted to work outdoors while remaining connected to my community. That very first season, I was hooked and went back to school to learn more about food systems, receiving my Masters in Sustainable Food & Farming from the University of Montana in 2015. I then launched a value-added produce business called Black Bear Soups, that has previously received and repaid a Kiva loan.\r\n\r\nYet, I struggled to access appropriate farmland for my farm dreams to be viable long-term. While owning and operating Black Bear Soups across several leased farm sites, I worked full-time in the nonprofit sustainability sector. I most recently was the Operations & Finance Director for the Community Food & Agriculture Coalition, who is now endorsing me for this Kiva loan. \r\n\r\nAbout two years ago, I had given up on the idea that I would ever farm full-time. Then, to great surprise, I was invited to work on transitioning a farm space from the retiring farmers who had previously managed it. The most exciting part, this project is attempting a new model for farmers like me to access land: a community land trust farm. I am the first lease holder of Montana\u2019s inaugural community land trust farm and as of two weeks ago, I became a full-time farmer.",

I, Am\u00e9rica Silva from Mexico City, and my now-husband Pablo Valencia from Puebla, remember that day vividly. I was vacationing in the United States, merely out for a family meal, when I serendipitously met Pablo, who was working at the restaurant. We talked that day, and from that moment on, we became great friends. We shared our dreams of owning a restaurant and event space for events and parties, so I decided to stay in the United States with Pablo, and we set our plans in motion.\n\nIt has been years since we first spoke about our dreams and began to cultivate the vision of a restaurant serving traditional Mexican cuisine. Our ambition was to preserve and showcase the rich culinary heritage of central and southern Mexico, and to bring a taste of Puebla, Oaxaca, and Mexico City to Wisconsin. My husband has honed his culinary skills since the age of 17 in the diverse kitchens of Madison's restaurants. Meanwhile, I have since graduated with a degree in Business Administration. We opened our first restaurant 4 years ago, but faced some complications, situations, and setbacks along our way, but they have not stopped us. We are determined to make our mark in the restaurant industry. We are constantly motivated by our children, Miranda and Emilio who give us the strength and energy.",

So things can get a little tricky for an Asian person who doesn\u2019t eat rice. However, I've never been too concerned about that since I simply eat noodles for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Problem solved, right?\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not quite that simple though \u2013 even the most dedicated noodle lovers don\u2019t always get to enjoy amazing noodles at restaurants three times a day. Sometimes you just need to go for the quick option: instant noodles. The big problem with that is the lack of nutrients and real authentic flavors. Although sometimes satisfying, a bag of regular instant noodles simply leaves you hungry and makes you think you should\u2019ve gone for a healthier option. But you still crave those delicious noodles ... So our mission at Noodelist is to introduce to the marketplace a premium plant-based version of instant noodles. We source noodles that are nutrient dense, texturally pleasing, and combine a bespoke soup base recipe that was created by award winning chef Petteri Luoto.\r\n\r\nWe wanted to create a flavorful and authentic experience that is not only good for you and great tasting; like you've spent hours in the kitchen, but is also good for the environment. That means no styrofoam cups for us! Our noodles are housed in environmentally conscious packaging. What more could you ask for? You'll find the only thing left on your plate is for you to share the oodles of love of our noodles. Be Happy and Noodle on!",
