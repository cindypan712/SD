Prior to moving to the United States, I owned and ran my own clothing design business, Pam's Moda, with 3 employees in Kinshasa. My inspiration to start Pam's Moda, after graduating from college, came from my love of clothing design and in particular African works, color, and style. When I moved to Vermont, I noticed that very few people had the sewing ability to make clothes and that many Africans living in Vermont had cloth at home ready to be made into clothing. I started by sewing clothing for my friends and family in Vermont and gradually Pam's Moda was reborn. Today demand has grown, and I outsource some of the work to former colleagues in the DRC, where I continue to also source my fabric.",

I come from a large family of 19 siblings. I have always had the passion for caring for others around me. I assisted my father with my 6 younger siblings as he worked hard to maintain our household, so caring for children has always been a huge part of my life. \r\n\r\nVerner is from Chicago, IL. He is CPR and OSHA 10 certified. He has a diverse career path that ranges from Apprenticeship to Personal Care services. After graduating from Paul Mitchell Barbering Program, he decided to pursue his career as a Barber and offer grooming services for children and adults. While\r\nentering the childcare field, he decided to offer services for families that may not have the time to get to a Barbershop or salon. Teaching children the concept of having patience, learning self-care all while providing a safe space.\r\n\r\nWe have two beautiful girls, Valani (6y) and Valeyah (3y). They are our inspiration for founding Little Swan's in 2023. Both of our children have severe asthma and there were many days where we were going from daycare to urgent care due to their health instructions not being followed by daycare staff. We attempted many daycares in our area, and we kept running into many safety hazards and lack of care. As any concerned parents, we took the necessary steps to become early childhood educators so that we can teach our own children. With the love and care that we provide for our children, family and friends began reaching out for care and soon enough we were at our maximum in our in-home location.\r\n\r\nAfter many inquiries in the area and having to turn many families around due to capacity, we started thinking of our business in a long-term aspect. Expanding would be the next move to make so that we can assist more families in our community. We have recently purchased a location to open our daycare facility, becoming a Licensed Group Childcare Facility. We strive to be able to provide a safe environment for all, all while focusing on early learning development and helping more families in need.",

At the age of 12, I would go to work with my father and type out his invoices.  Of course, this was quite a few years ago, before any computers.  At 17, I was running the business when my father had his first heart attack. And that is when my management skills kicked in. I pursued an accounting degree and after marrying, I continued to work in the private sector as a Controller.  \n\nFor the past 20 years, I've been a Controller of country clubs and yacht clubs.  This gave me experience in the hospitality and food and beverage business.  Coming from an Italian family, I love to cook and eat.  I am a foodie.'\n\nI've always dreamed of having my type of business and food is a passion of mine.  Five years ago, my fiance and I began looking into a small sub shop.  As we continued to pursue it, more and more ideas were generated.  Our concept just grew into one that is not found here.  So I started to pursue my dream.\n\nThen, in July 2023, I came down with Guillain Barre Syndrome and was paralyzed from the waist down within 4 days.  After days hospitalized and seven weeks in in-patient rehab, I was able to go home, but only using a walker.  I have just begun to walk with a walking stick.  During this time, my restaurant is going through licensing issues with the build out and while hospitalized, my fiance had a stroke.  It has been a long road since it started over a year ago.  And as I get to the end of the build out, my funds are running very low.  Funds allocated to the build out were forced to be used for rents that were not anticipated, since our expected open date was to have been July 1st then moved to Sept 1st waiting for permits.  Needless to say,  my stress levels are up, but I have not let this put me down.  The rehab unit said I was a phenomenon as they did not expect me to even be able to walk with a walker when I left, let alone climb stairs, so I could return to my home.  \n\nThe funds I pursue are to purchase final small wares and supplies and have a cash flow for 2 months of payroll.",
