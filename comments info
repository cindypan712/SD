There are some obvious things to learn here. \n\n1) Abortion just killed many Republicans. Tons of conservatives buried their head in the sand because they were giddy over Dobbs and ignored the reality that this is a gigantic loser for Republicans. It created a ton of single issue voters that could have easily been had in this environment had it not been for Dobbs and then Republicans taking wildly unpopular positions on it in the aftermath. Conservatives need to do what the libs do on guns. Bite their lip, and run away screaming towards being very moderate at worst on it.\n\n2) Until we can get Election Day back instead of election month, conservatives need to do a 180 on early voting and encourage it just as hard as Dems do. I’m sure we lose tons of would be voters on Election Day when something happens and they don’t make it to the polls. Votes that could be had if they planed on voting early or even by mail and had the flexibility to overcome an issue keeping them from voting day of. Dems get to keep those would be lost votes because they have correctly identified this.\n\n3) Trump has to go man. I know there’s lots of big Trump fans here but he’s just a huge drag on the entire party. He’s a huge net loser in general elections and yesterday reiterated what we failed to learn 2 years ago. It’s time to jettison him today. We don’t need him anywhere near the future of the GOP and we certainly don’t need him losing a primary, doing his fraud thing and keeping people from supporting them in a general.\n\n4) GOP strategy and messaging leadership all needs to go. Fact of the matter is this was the best possible climate to make huge waves and they lost a lot of messaging battles when all the Dems had is “democracy at risk and abortion.” The GOP utterly failed to make any coherent case on why they are the obvious better choice.\n\n5) Candidate quality matters and we need to keep that in mind going forward. Oz and Walker are jokes. Mastreino was so bad it probably costed Oz the win. Kinda ties into the Trump point but running these losers was always a doomed practice.\n\n6) Time to drop the stolen election routine. People don’t like it. They don’t like it when Mastreino does it, they don’t like it when Abrams does it. If the GOP can’t message correctly and define the line between loose voting practices (good) and Trump trying to get as many people to say “it was stolen” (bad) then they just need to stay away from it all together.\n\nWe will get the house, and can stonewall most of Bidens agenda for the next 2 years while hopefully the GOP figure this stuff out.', 'time': 1668002941.0, 'score': 2181, 'replies': <praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x118911b10>}

To me this is genuinely important because if you actually follow Biden\'s career he\'s: \n\nA. Not a nice guy (to me this isn\'t a problem, I want politicians that put policies I like in place not ones who are nice) but yet the fact that Trump isn\'t nice is apparently a deal-breaker for Trump.\n\nB. One of the most inconsistent politicians that could have possibly been picked. He has flip-flopped on basically every single stance he has at one point or another in this election, purely depending on who he is talking to (Kamala is no different). The lack of willingness to be honest about his positions, or to make firm policy declarations, and act only in a way that is politically expedient to his self-interests is very concerning to me. \n\nTrump might be abrasive,  he might be a poor speaker, and lord knows he is not a master at expressing his points accurately. However, in the last 4 years he has actually been very, very consistent to the promises he campaigned on. "Trust a man by his actions, not his words." Now, that said you may not like his policies which you stated and that\'s an entirely different conversation that would take a long time to hash out. But do we even really know what Biden\'s policies are? The only policies he\'s actually talked about in any detail that I\'ve seen is his COVID response plan, which is exactly the same as Trump\'s plan... the other policies he talks about are vague and seem to have a different answer every time. Or even no answer, "I\'m not going to answer that because then that\'s what you would focus on" is pretty much his exact answer to reporters on questions and policies that he doesn\'t want to discuss. That\'s no better than Pelosi\'s "you have to pass \\[Obamacare\\] to know what\'s in it".\n\nC. Not capable at handling international relations, even the [Obama Defense Sec stated that Biden has been wrong on every foreign policy decision in 40 years.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=febAgZ0RdF4) There\'s also a fairly plausible argument that the Middle East peace agreements would crumble if Biden wins because Israel would lose their US backing which is the cornerstone of the current peace agreements. Biden does have a record of being pro-China, giving them favorable trade deals that did effectively destroy American jobs. During his time as vice-president he also argued that fixing NATO and NAFTA was impossible, both feats that Trump accomplished very early on into his presidency which have literally no downside for the American people regardless of your political leanings.\n\nD. Biden is a legitimate racist. Unlike with Trump you do not need to clip him out of context to create the impression of racism. Biden has made so many comments that can only be described as racist, and yet no one seems to care. From picking a running mate purely because of skin color and sex, to the plethora of comments he\'s made and keeps making that shows that he not only expects black people to get in line but that they\'re not as good as white people. I find him deeply offensive, and I find it even more confusing that people who scream about Trump being racist (while literally having to take him out of context to do it) are completely fine with a man who was against integrating schools because he didn\'t want his children in a "racial jungle".\n\nSo really, while I understand why someone wouldn\'t vote Trump for policy reasons, I really have to turn this around and ask why do you support Biden?

I consider Trump to fit the definition of a [Useful Idiot](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/useful-idiot).  \n\nHe\'s a tool... an EFFECTIVE tool.  \n\n* He got us out of Paris.  \n\n* He got us out of the TPP.  \n\n* He got us tax reform.  \n\n* He got NAFTA renegotiated.  \n\n* He moved the US embassy to Israel to Jerusalem, while simultaneously negotiating peace treaties between Israel and islamic countries.\n\n* He radically reduced federal regulation of industry.  \n\nEven Trump\'s failures are useful.  The things that REALLY infuriate people about him aren\'t the *content* of what he says or does (not all that different from any other Republican)... it\'s the **tone**...  HOW he says things.  And that\'s where Trump has been the most useful of idiots:  He RIDICULES the opposition, and that means that suddenly correct positions that would normally have rhetorically failed because of the limitations of sensitivity and politeness, despite being correct, can be broached anyway.  You could be forgiven for thinking that this would not be a huge tactical advantage in politics, but that fails to consider it in context:  The left has spent the last 30+ years getting advances in their agendas, almost exclusively not by making coherent rational points that are legitimately convincing for logical reasons, but by a method called "shaping the dialog"... \n\nThe general method of dialog shaping is: \n\n1. Find a victim who exemplifies your world-view/desires-for intervention (The most effective victims are children, or indigenous people who conveniently either do not speak English or are geographically isolated and thus require your services as advocate to express themselves to the world.  (You don\'t actually have to express what they say... just what you think they ought to say).   Another good choice is people in the unspecified future; large groups of victims are preferable to small ones as it lets you use hyperbolic language:  "Trillions will die".  Non-human victims can also be chosen, but they should be chosen for maximum emotional appeal: The Environment, Nature, Animals, God, you Ancestors, etc.  The important thing in choosing the victim is that you choose one where some third party can not come between you and the victim and replace you as the voice of the victim to the world.  As long as that remains true, you can ditch any individual victim(s) who have outlived their rhetorical usefulness.  \n\n2. Whine about the victim publicly, and thus whine about the problems in your worldview or about your desires.  \n\n3. Attack anybody who suggests that the problem isn\'t important because they are therefore (by extension) attacking the victim.  This works even if the victim is profoundly non-representative of the whole:  "How can you put a price on human suffering you monster... ONE child suffering from <insert rare problem you\'ve never heard of before here>, is one too many!"  \n\n4. Only people who accept the world-view/desires are treated as respecting the victim, and thus taking the subject seriously.  In this way you get to dismiss people saying things like "Curing that problem will cost hundreds of trillions of dollars a day, and require that everybody give up on technology!"... You dismiss such arguments as not taking the situations seriously on the level of emotional and suffering as exemplified by your victim.... without ever having to actually, you know, ANSWER the other side\'s arguments.  \n\nThe fiasco of the Kavanaugh rape-accusations is a textbook example of argument by dialog shaping.  Almost EVERYTHING that comes out of the mouths of modern Leftists is dialog shaping following this script.  It has totally eclipsed almost all other liberal rhetoric.  Dialog shaping is an intrinsically evil and corrupt methodology of rhetoric as it is specifically designed to evade logical evidence based analysis in favor of emotional reactions invoked by the callous use of victims.  Despite it\'s evil, the method works AMAZINGLY well!  I don\'t know if Trump discovered it, but he\'s certainly the first to broadly use the counter to this rhetorical strategy:  When the other guy says you\'re not taking the victim seriously (step 3)... AGREE!  say "You\'re right.  I don\'t take your victim seriously!  Nor do I recognize the value or legitimacy to the issue(s) behind your victim... in fact the only reason you care about your victim is to use him as a tool in your agenda which is __________! "  Saying that aloud lets everybody else admit in private, perhaps only the privacy in their own head, "Yeah, that whole thing really was kind of ridiculous!"  And along the way they also see the true motivations of the dialog shaper which is almost always self-serving.  (As H.L.Menken wrote: "The desire to save humanity is almost always a false face on the desire to rule it".)  So, seemingly paradoxically, Trump\'s tone will, in the long run, cause the political dialog to become MORE rational and based upon real things and not emotional (and almost always imagined) victim-oppressor dynamics.   It will do this by making the dialog shaping methodology simply not work anymore... If it doesn\'t work, it will be abandoned.', 'time': 1604525490.0, 'score': 11, 'replies': <praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x119231c90>}

{'id': 'gb6i2or', 'author': Redditor(name='0siris0'), 'flair': 'Pragmatist', 'body': 'The best political description for me is that I\'m a right wing liberal.   I believe in the rights to life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness, endowed by the Creator.  I take all those words and concepts seriously, particularly the "Creator" component.  This, by nature, is going to pull my sympathies towards an ideology, a movement, a group, that recognizes philosophical materialism will not be able to sustain the values required for human civilization in the long run.  The average non believer, competing against a religious world, can emotionally put together the justification that he or she doesn\'t need God to be ethical.  Give it three generations, if organized religion was snapped out of existence Thanos style, when that emotional impetus is gone and people have to cope with consequences of retroactive nothingness on sacrifice, cooperation, and stick-to-it-ness in light of adversity.   \n\nI also know the free market, as a default system, is superior to statism.  History has born this out.  I\'m not going to go more into that here but I have a recommended reading list of various sources with pretty irrefutable arguments against the tenets substantiating Bernie Sanders and AOC, ie the base of the modern DNC.   \n\nI also defer to, and admire, and protect, those people who choose to put themselves on the line to save and protect other.  Ie, enlisted servicemen and the police.  Doesn\'t mean I support every war, or corruption in the DoD, or rotten cops.  It just means Colin Kapernick\'s default posture is inimical to me, and his literal and metaphorical posture is common in the modern DNC.   \n\nI also know human life begins at conception.   This is logical, and has nothing to do with the Creator.  A fetus has a unique replicating DNA that is growing and expanding its cells until it becomes a full human. Whether this is inside the womb or out is irrelevant.  That is a matter of circumstance, not being.  A sperm does not regenerate itself and expand.  An egg does not either.  They are created and form, or expire as they were created.   So masturbation and ovulation isn\'t the same as abortion.  So any ideology that makes such an argument is irrational and immoral.  Comparing a fetus to a tapeworm is an abomination.   And I say this as someone who doesn\'t care about the legality of abortion.   The role of the government is to maintain the social order, not enforce morality, even if in many instances (illegalizing outright murder, for example...murder is evil, but it\'s illegal because if people were murdering each other, everyone would spend their time protecting their life and property instead of pursuing the specialized labor necessary for civilization...no doctors, no engineers, no plumbers, no farmers, just hunters and gatherers guarding what\'s theirs until they die...even if there is an obvious overlap between the evil of murder and its role in social disorder).  \n\nBut, I\'m not here to argue that as much as state a posture that makes me a yellow dog republican...even if a) I don\'t care for the candidate or b) outside of all i said above, I\'m actually pretty sympathetic to many "left wing" causes.   I want to see the poor helped.  I am NOT a lassiez faire libertarian.  I am a Hayekian, not a Misesian or Godawful Rothbardian when it comes to the Austrian school.   I support a progressive tax.  I\'m open to increasing taxes on millionaires--particularly those in trivial industries and those who don\'t directly support a small business--to pay more than what they pay now.  I believe in a social safety net.  I believe in aggressive programs that help people to help themselves, I believe in second and third and fourth chances, i believe the GOP\'s laxness in addressing the needs of the black community is abominable, I believe in a strong public education system, I believe people *should* go to college to recieve both a liberal arts education on civilization  *and* practical training in specialized (STEM) fields that the market needs, I believe in listening and learning and indulging in other cultures, I believe in common sense regulations that protect the people and environment at large, I love our national parks, I loathe censorship (whether progressive or southern Baptist and I am a very evangelical Christian) and I believe the *government* is *vital* to *protect and promote* one of the *best engines* in human civilization....the *free market*.   I am more than open to a discussion on what we can adopt from the Nordic governments here...most of which are actually capitalist and not socialist.  If Democrats were smarter, they\'d abandon any and all terms relating to socialism or social democracy, and make an affirmative stance for a protected and guarded free market and private property.  They\'d do so much better.  It\'s what Clinton/Gore/Lieberman did in the 90s to reverse the stench of left wing radicalism from the 60s, yet here it comes again within the *base* of the Dems and AOC, Sanders, academia, and the like.  \n\nSo...any movement, base, or candidate representing that base or movement must be stopped.  And I have had many, many, many reservations about Trump since 2015.   I campaigned for McCain back in 2000 when I was in college and he was going against W for the gop nomination.  I thought Trumps attacks on the GOP establishment was unconscionably stupid, you don\'t turn down allies, he had all the room in the world to policy wise distance himself from the so-called NEO-cons without making it personal and alienating allies.  When whatever emerged between him and McCain happened, instead of saying "He\'s a loser (as if Trump would\'ve beaten Obama) and I prefer my servicemen to not be captured!" (One of the dumbest thing ever said in politics),  he said "I respect John and what he has accomplished, but I am taking our servicemen away from endless wars, and I understand his concerns over an outsider like me, but I\'m confident, when I the Republican nomination and the presidency, that he and I can sit down and come up with 9 things we agree over against the 1 thing I don\'t."   Trump wouldn\'t lose this election if that was his tenor in regards to the previous GOP nominees, whom tens of millions of people voted for, donated to, and sacrifices time and money for, instead did the FIGHT EVERYONE IN A SHITFEST approach Trump has taken since 2015.  \n\nI voted for Gary Johnson in 2016 and Trump in 2020.  I did the latter because the socialism, the fetus-as-tapeworm, the cancel culture, the Big Tech censorship, the media bias, the defunding of the police, the social disorder, the coddling of the American mind, the calling everyone who disagrees with the Dems a fascist/racist/sexist with a laughable of actual historic fascism/racism/sexism, the rioting, the 96 genders, the 1619 project, the critical race theory, the cultural appropriation nonsense, the insistence on an external locus of control instead of an inner one...I put up with Trump because Biden is a vanguard for all of that.', 'time': 1604539075.0, 'score': 5, 'replies': <praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x119232d10>}

The green new deal and getting back into the Paris accord. The green new deal will destroy our economy legitimately bankrupt several large communities across the country while increasing our dependence on foreign import for at least 5 years till new businesses can develop to compete. The Paris accord while has a noble goal will cause much deeper debt as it will require us to pay in tons of money.  \n\n\nBiden also stands on Obamacare and claiming to try and "fix" it. Well as someone who is still dealing with the issues the original Obamacare caused (family losing doctors they had years of experience with and a dramatic reduction in quality of healthcare) I do not have ANY faith in what Biden has planned for healthcare.  \n\n\nBiden has outright lied on multiple occasions, most notable recently was him saying on the last debate that he never said he would ban fracking. Yet not more than 15 minutes later there was a video of him and Kamala both saying it over 10 times that they intend to get rid of fracking. The whole Hunter Biden laptop which claims to show Joe Biden takes part in "pay to play". To my knowledge they have never really denied any of the claims of the emails or that the emails were false. It was said that it was all a Russian misinformation hoax, but then they asked for the laptop back. If it was all fake, why do you want the laptop back?  \n\n\nBefore the pandemic forced a global shutdown, we had the best economy we have had in decades. The company I personally work for (we make industrial equipment for companies like Coke, Pepsi, Arizona Ice Tea, etc) business has been BOOMING the last couple years. Even in the middle of the pandemic we are booked out till March of 2021. It took several weeks of complete shut down before we fell down the Obama\'s economic high.  \n\n\nPeople say Trump mishandled Covid. Hindsight says yea, it probably could have been handled better. BUT, hindsight also shows us that when trump forced a shutdown on all travel from china, Biden called trump a xenophobe and Pelosi went dancing in the streets. We can also look back and see that when Trump said dont wear masks, like a week earlier Foucci said to not wear masks in an interview (Foucci later admitted that was a lie so the people wouldnt buy them all up and the hospitals wouldn\'t have what they needed, so Trump was just echoing him) Also, when Biden was asked what he would do about covid in the last debate, EVERY SINGE THING he said Trump is already doing. Which leads me to believe that Biden wouldn\'t have done any better.  \n\n\nTrump has done or has tried very hard to do just about everything he said he would in his campaign 4 years ago. Biden has been in the federal government for 50 years and cant say that bout a SINGLE term. The only real thing with Biden\'s name on it in that 50 years is the crime bill of 1994 which made the systemic racism/prison issue worse and even he admitted was wrong and a mistake.  \n\n\nSo in return. Other than Trump being "racist and hateful" (which i have yet to see any proof of, or at least any proof he said anything more racist than Biden in the last year "If you have trouble deciding if you are for me or trump, then you aint black" -Biden 2020) What makes you think after 50 years Biden will finally get off his ass and "fix" this country more than what Trump did in the last 4 years?', 'time': 1604518165.0, 'score': 2, 'replies': <praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x119234550>}

{'id': 'fzqm4nh', 'author': Redditor(name='GeneticsGuy'), 'flair': 'E pluribus unum', 'body': "Hello fellow conservatives lol. Clearly Trump is trying to stir the pot and trigger people with this. He is basically trying to flip the lockdowns against the Dems because you know this is going to trigger them. Trump keeps saying we just need to have a NORMAL election. Polling stations open. People can show up with masks if they must. The Democrats are basically the ones trying to rewrite the election by demanding universal mail-in voting, which every state that is doing stress tests on it right now it keeps failing and turning into a mess. Also, the concern with mail-in voting is mass ballot printing and harvesting with no accountability.\n\nLet me explain. In some states, like Arizona, that do have early mail-in voting, to even implement the system there were some serious agreements put into place with both political parties, observation, accountability metrics put into place, and some testing and and there were a lot of hiccups before they finally sort of got it right, and even with all of that a lot of people still get upset at the mail-in voting in Arizona because if the in-person voting seems skewed in one direction a certain way, the state says it's not worth the effort to count the mail-in ballots so they don't. They only count the mail-in ballots if the election is within something like 5% range from in-person balloting. A lot of people don't even know that their ballot is not counted each year because their district the opposing candidate won in-person voting by X%, so they didn't even bother to count their ballot. It is like this in much of America. But, if it is less, the mail-in ballots can take up to a week to tally, so you end up with unclear election results and results that don't come up for up to a week after the election. How do you think that will go down in the US? Remember Florida Broward county and how days after the election they kept finding boxes of uncounted ballots, and they denied all political observers from their counting and recounting and so on? Imagine this at a national level now where either side can shut out the other side from equal observation of ballot chain of custody, or some states implementing rules of mass mail-in with ZERO chain of custody rules.\n\nNow, we get to universal mail-in ballots being demanded by some governors. Well, guess what... those states do NOT have security in place. They do not have equal observation of printing by both parties, accountability, chain of custody requirements. In a place like California the entire chain of custody of all mail-in-ballots will be done by their entire super-majority Democrat run states who have Democrat run election commissions. And, they are just mass sending out the ballots. In a place like Arizona you literally have to opt-in to voting on the mail-in ballot and when you go to vote in-person at a polling station if you already voted in-person at a polling station they won't even let you because it says on the sheet at your polling station that you opted for a mail-in ballot. Well, guess what, in these states implementing mass mail-in balloting, they aren't doing anything like that. No accountability. Since there was no opt-in database, and they are sending ballots to all AND they are going to have some ballot stations open, there is literally ZERO way for their states to know if you sent in your ballot or you voted in person. Why? Because, ballots are supposed to have no identifiable markers. So, you could send your ballot mail-in AND show up the same day and vote in person. Why not? The ballots are anonymous. what's to stop people from doing this? You know many will if they can get away with it.\n\nThe only thing checked is that you CAN vote, but once in, your name is not on that ballot to identify you. Mail-in ballots also do not have your name on them. So, you could in theory just take your mail-in ballot and drop it off at the polling station in their collection box. And, in a state like California, they made a law a few years ago that literally *anyone* can bring your ballot for you on your behalf and drop it off. Think about that. Anyone can just show up to a ballot station and drop off thousands of ballots and just claim that they got these ballots from neighbors and are dropping them off on their behalf. They are completely unmarked with any identifiers.\n\nDoes this open up an opportunity and vector for fraud? You betcha. It likely has already happened to some extent, and now many states want to implement an executive ordered, quick mass mail-in ballot?\n\nYa, I don't trust it. If the chain of custody could be guaranteed, fine. But I don't think it can be nor does it seem like these Democrat run states pushing this want it to be. They are doing nothing to alleviate people's worry about fraud. They are doing nothing to diminish potential vectors for fraud and they mock anyone that states otherwise.\n\nHence, Trump is saying they want a NORMAL election and he is now trolling them with statements like this because they always do the opposite of what he says and maybe the media will push to ensure a normal election now.", 'time': 1596123842.0, 'score': -19, 'replies': <praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x1196e6690>}
