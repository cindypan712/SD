To my surprise, obviously that didn't happen and a very significant portion of the country really believes in Trump apparently. I don't agree with any of his policies, and to put it lightly, I'm not a fan of his character. As a result of that, I genuinely don't understand what it is about him that compels someone to vote for him. \n\nBut, the thing that I'm most tired of is the massive bipartisan divide in this country that has caused so much hostility from both sides, and I think the first step to improving the situation is to make a real effort to understand each other. So, if some of you would take the time to help me understand why you believe in Trump, I would appreciate it. Thanks.\n\nEDIT: Wow, this got way more attention than I thought it would. I thought this would get two or three comments and vanish in new. Thank you all for answering, and thank you for your civility. I'm not really responding to comments because unfortunately I don't have time to have a meaningful conversation right now, but also I made this post with the intention to just listen to what you all have to say without me throwing any of my specific views into the mix. I'll try to read as many as I can, and I might respond to one or two later if I have time. \n\nThanks again",
