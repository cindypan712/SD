Once inside, the rioters chatting nonchalantly with Capitol police and one rioter even taking a selfie with one\n\nNone of that makes a lick of sense, especially given the violence that erupted after. It's the U.S. Capitol, a historic site where (sometimes) important work is done for this country. You would think it would be heavily guarded and with great effort with a protest in process. Yet, it seems the people guarding it weren't doing their job not only to the best of their ability, but AT ALL.",

We were rational and law abiding people. \n\nNow, we are all going to be condemned by the actions of a small portion of the people that went down for the protest.

By comparison, it was a fringe, unacceptable position this summer to condemn the destruction of small businesses which **literally are** what makes America great - enterprising people who support themselves and their families by serving their communities.\n\nAnd of course by \"over the summer\" I mean in regards to BLM protests. That's not even beginning to touch on the government response to the pandemic. That's a similar scary parallel where it has been viewed as virtuous to rat on your neighbors for trying to make a living or having a party, closing others' businesses via threat of force is the status quo, and a non-elected government official who outright lies to the American people was celebrated as a hero.",

          "body": "Reading Biden's speech with subtitles in a sports bar.\n\nSome things worth objecting too, but by and large, it's a reasonable theme and explains whatever appeal he actually has.  His theme of unity, of treating his opponents as Americans, of healing, certainly won't persuade me to ever be a democrat, but I wish to Christ it had been Trump's message for four years.  The themes of this speech should have been Trump's since January 2017, and if you can't see that, you can't see how Biden could have possibly won this election legitimately.  His use of the Bible verses on everything having a season was brilliant.  \n\nTrump had some stupid stupid advisors out the gate, Bannon is a doofus, and he easily could have given his version of this type of speech.  Yeah, Left would have rejected it, so what.  This election shows the center almost always wins.   Be reasonable.  \n\nNow, Biden's gonna have a problem, because the progressives ain't having any of this.  It will be interesting how his battle with the Left.  In my lifetime, two Democrats have won the presidency in 1992 and 2008, and now 2020.  In both 92 and 08, the GOP took the house and senate two years later.  \n\nThe American people doesn't want the Left.   But they don't want divisive personalities either, whether Hillary or Trump.  Take that to heart, and adjust accordingly moving forward.  Trump taught republicans how to fight, now the time is to fight with wisdom, long term strategy, and decency.",
